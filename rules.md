# WolfQuiz

## Requirements

 * Minimum 3 players to be interesting
 * A Discord server
 * Java knowledges is a plus (or at least a Java IDE)

## Rules

The rules are simple : the Game Master (GM) has a set of questions. Every player has to guess the correct answer to earn points. The votes are public and individual, and everyone has to give its opinion publicly.

Each player that gave the correct answer gain the same amount of points as the number of people that gave the correct answer... OK, that's tricky, let's take an example : players A, B and C gave the correct answer and D and E did not. Then, A, B and C earn 3 points each, and D and E earn nothing.

BUT, there are some Wolves in the area ! Every wolf earns 2 points for every person that gave an incorrect answer to the question (itself excluded) and 0 point otherwise.

The wolfes are teamed up and know their teammates. The wolves remain the same players for the next 3 questions. The GM give them the correct answer at every question in private.

At the end of each question, the GM tells everyone what was the correct answer and let the players debate for who they think are the wolves (but no votes). The scores are not revealed at every question.

At the end of 3rd question, the players can vote for who they think are the wolves. They have +2 point for every correctly spotted wolf, -2 points for every incorrect vote, and 0 if not voted. The wolves can vote but will not earn or loose any point from this vote. The player(s) that get(s) the most votes loose(s) 3 points. The scores are revealed and the wolf team is re-rolled.

### Exemple

Players are : Adèle, Blanchard, Clément, Denis, Eglandine and Ferdinand.

There are 2 wolves that are Adèle and Blanchard. 

**Question 1 : How do you translate "joke" in Swedish ?**
  * **A** : glädje
  * **B** : skämt
  * **C** : lycklig
  * **D** : kyckling

The correct answer is "B : skämt", and Adèle and Blanchard know that.

Adèle says that it could be "lycklig", as it looks like "liking", and that everyone likes jokes. Clément hesitates between "skämt" and "glädje", but will choose "skämt". Blanchard says that he knows that "kyckling" means "chicken", so it must be the other one, so "lycklig". Denis follows the idea of Clement ("skämt"), and Eglandine and Ferdinand choose "lycklig".

At the end, we have 2 correct answers and 4 incorrect ones. From this question, Adèle and Blanchard earns 6 points each (4 incorrect answers - their own answer = 3 incorrect answers from others, and 3*2 = 6 points... I know, maths aren't funny but hey, the app should make it for you ^^ ). Denis and Clement earns 2 points each. Eglandine and Ferdinand earn nothing.

**Question 2 : In Star Wars, what is the name of the planet destroyed by the first Death Star ?**
  * **A** : Tatooine
  * **B** : Naboo
  * **C** : Alderaan
  * **D** : Endor

The correct answer is "C : Alderaan".

Clément is confident in the answer C has he knows Star Wars by heart. Because he gave a correct answer previously, everyone follows him except Adèle, that is sure that this is "Naboo". 

At the end, Adèle and Blanchard earn 0 point, and all of the others earn 5 points each (5 correct answers, including Blanchard's vote).

**Question 3 : True or False : The T-shirt is the official undershirt in the US-Navy in 1919.**
  * **A** : True
  * **B** : False

The correct answer is "A : True".

Eglandine laughts and says that it cannot be true. Ferdinand, that is madly in love with Eglandine, says the same. Adèle, Blanchard and Denis follow this answer. Clément is the only one who says that it is "True".

At the end, Clément earns 1 point, Adèle and Blanchard earn 8 points each, and the others nothing.

**Wolves Vote Time !**

Then, it is time to make people vote for who they think are the 2 wolves. Blanchard the Traitor votes for Adèle only. Clément is voting for Adèle and Blanchard, because HE knows the truth. Adèle, furious, votes for Eglantine. Eglantine, jealous, votes for Adèle and Denis, because Denis seems weird. Denis vote for Eglantine and Ferdinand. The others choose not to vote.

From this vote, Clément earns 2 + 2 = 4 points, Eglantine earns + 2 - 2 = 0 points. Denis looses 4 points. The others (including Adèle and Blanchard) do not earn or loose points. Adèle, that has the more votes, looses 3 points.

After this 3 questions, the results are :
Adèle : 6 + 0 + 8 - 3 = **11** <br>
Blanchard : 6 + 0 + 8 + 0 = **14** <br>
Clément : 2 + 5 + 1 + 4 = **12** <br>
Denis : 2 + 5 + 0 - 4 = **3** <br>
Eglantine : 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 = **5** <br>
Ferdinand : 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 = **5** <br>

We roll the wolves, show the scores and here we go again !
