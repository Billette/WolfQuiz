# Rules of the WolfQuiz

## Concept

The game is designed for at least 4 players + the Game Master (GM). The GM needs to prepare a set of questions with possible answers A, B, C and D. 

The players are split between 2 or more teams. Even if you are in a team, you have a your own personal point count as a player. The winner is the one who has the biggest number of points at the end of the game.

At each question, the players of the first team can publicly consult each other, vote and then give an answer to the GM. Same for the second team, etc... do not forget to alternate the starting team at each question. A correct answer gives one point to all the players of the team (some exceptions below).

Where the fun begins is when the GM attribute a role to a player at each round (question). the GM can make its own roles, make multiple people have the same role, multiple roles per person etc...

The app makes the roles attributed randomly, with some respect to the rules set by the GM.

Some roles are public and must be visible to everyone, and some are private and might be revealed or not at the end of a round. Private roles must stay hidden during the round.

Here are some keywords to describe the effects of the roles :
* **Warcry** : The effect triggers at the start of the round.
* **Death Wish** : The effect triggers at the end of the round.
* **Surprise** : The effect triggers whenever the GM decides it.
* **Bonus Malus** : If the player succeeds in performing their role during the round, they earn 1 point. Otherwise, they lose 1 point.

## Roles

Here is a list of roles you can apply to each player :

### Public

 * **The King** : &nbsp;&nbsp; If the players of a team do not agree on an answer, the King decides an answer for its team.
